                            Whether it be riding my motorcycle thorough the hills of San Luis Obispo or playing my 
                            guitar in a hammock on the beach, if I’m outside I’m having a good time. My interest in fire started as a 
                            young boy. My grandparents owned a mountain cabin and my family would frequently visit. 
                            Every so often we would have to rake the property and burn the pine needles to reduce the chances of a 
                            wild fire taking place. I remember being both amazed and shocked by large fires and ever since then I have 
                            always loved having a good old fashioned bonfire." -<strong>Derek</strong>
