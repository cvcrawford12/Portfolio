Some projects from the past 3 months

These projects consist of a variety of projects ranging from landing pages to dynamic express apps. Some of the projects are just for fun and others were for an internship and school projects.

MentMe branch contains the progress on my senior project which is a combination of a learning platform, a mentorship platform, and a social platform all for people looking to better their skills or lifes in a particular area.

FastFire branch contains a project I helped a friend with when he needed some extra flare for a school project which required him to build a product and basically make a start up.

Euroblog branch contains a project I made for fun prior to spending the summer in Europe in order to keep track of my photos and the places I've been. It is a dynamic express.js app equipt with authentication and the ability for users to comment and post.

9inesports branch contains some of the projects I worked on in a web development internship in Barcelona, Spain where my main focus was on UI Development. The templates ranged from landing pages for procurement of partnering clubs to an infographics dashboard for management to later use in strategic decisions.

These a just a few of my projects from the last few months.
