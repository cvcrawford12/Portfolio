# MentMe
Beta version of MentMe web application

This app is my senior project and is a Node.js application made with bootstrap, node, express.js, css, html, and MongoDB.

The focus of the project is to create a learning platform where users can develop specific skills by choosing a path and connecting with a mentor, a social network of other people on that path, and the content provided by the platform related to that path (videos, articles, books, tutorials, etc.).

Currently I am just working on the UI/UX before implementing the database and have completed beta versions of the home page, actions/messages page, and the profile pages. 

The profile pages are important because this is where users set up their 'personality profile' which will then later be used to find them the right potential mentors and development paths.
